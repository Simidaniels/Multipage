### ✅ **Conclusion**

The **Contact Us** and **About Me** pages together demonstrate my ability to build **accessible**, **semantic**, and **responsive** web pages using **plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** — all while adhering to **data-testid** protocol for automated testing.

The **Contact Us** page showcases essential form-handling skills — including client-side **validation**, **error feedback**, and **success confirmation** and well labeled inputs.

Meanwhile, the **About Me** page reflects my personal insight and structured writing using semantic elements like `<main>` and `<section>` to ensure both readability and accessibility.

Overall, this project effectively combines my technical skill, user centered designed and self reflection, aligning perfectly with modern frontend development standards.

Finally all folders are well arranged.
