            <h2>My Bio</h2>
            <p>
                I’m a passionate web developer and a graduate in physics exploring the world of technology and science.
                I enjoy exploring how digital tools can make life simpler and more creative.

            <h2>Goals in This Program</h2>
            <p>
                My main goal is to strengthen and improve my technical and problem-solving skills, learn best practices in frontend
                development,
                and become confident building accessible, responsive, and maintainable web applications.

            <h2>Areas of Low Confidence</h2>
            <p>
                I sometimes struggle with debugging complex JavaScript logic and optimizing performance,
                but I’m actively and consistently practicing through projects and videos online.

            <h2>Note to Future Self</h2>
            <p>
                Remember that progress comes from consistency, not perfection.
                Never stop learning, stay humble, and never stop experimenting with new ideas as practice makes improvements.

            <h2>Extra Thoughts</h2>
            <p>
                Collaboration and mentorship would make the learning journey meaningful.
                I hope to contribute and make a positive impact to the team I join and I inspire others to do the same.
